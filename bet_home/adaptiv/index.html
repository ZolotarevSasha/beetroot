                Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test.
                According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates
                questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re
                confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

                    In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.
                    I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find the
                    parallels
                    later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time
                    perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

                    I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. For each
                    of
                    those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular
                    flow
                    and
                    jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
